My name is Vincent Brouwer, and I hail from the Netherlands. I reside in Zutphen, a quaint town nestled in the province of Gelderland.

I have a passion for creating beauty and am enamored by the enduring nature of code's conceptual permanence. It's an art form that transcends time, destined to outlast me, for better or for worse. This is what fuels my drive.
