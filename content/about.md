Hello! My name is Vincent Brouwer and I'm from the Netherlands. I live in Zutphen which is a small town in the province of Gelderland. Most of my life I've been very interested in anything that had to do with computers, whether it was gaming or programming I was always looking for a way to make it do new things.
