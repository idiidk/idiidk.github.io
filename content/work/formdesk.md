# Formdesk

Formdesk is a project I worked on while working at [B302, A creative media mob](https://b302.nl). It is a site where students of the HAN University of Applied Sciences can view different metrics of studys abroad to decide if it's right for them. The description that's on the site itself is as follows:

Thinking about studying abroad? Good choice, spending time abroad not only fulfils academic goals, but also lets you experience a new culture, language and environment. Jumping into a new experience can be difficult and overwhelming, but lucky for you, we are here to help!

Here you will find information about our partner universities, based on the experiences of HAN students, who studied there in the past. They have given their impressions about the university, the campus and the country, etc., which will help you prepare for your Study Abroad adventure.

I primarily worked on the front-end of the site which is made in React. I worked in a team of about 5 students working closely together with the back-end team to realise the complete front-end of the site.

The site is currently in production at: [https://formdesk-2.acc.theburo.nl/](https://formdesk-2.acc.theburo.nl/)
